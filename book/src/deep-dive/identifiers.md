# Identifiers for Distributed Systems

Identifier guidance now lives alongside the chapters that use it. For the taxonomy of intrinsic/extrinsic and abstract/semantic identifiers, see [Architecture](../architecture.md#identifier-taxonomy) and [Schemas](../schemas.md#identifier-shapes-and-entropy). Ownership semantics for `ExclusiveId` and `IdOwner` are covered in the [Architecture](../architecture.md#trible-sets) discussion of the data model.
