# Blobs

Blob guidance is now folded into the storage chapters. See [Architecture](../architecture.md#blob-storage) for how blob handles pair hashes with schemas and [Pile Format](../pile-format.md) for on-disk details. Repository examples continue in [Repository Workflows](../repository-workflows.md#working-with-custom-blobs).
