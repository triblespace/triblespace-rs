# Blobs

Blobs are immutable byte sequences used whenever data does not fit in a
trible's fixed 256-bit value slot. `BlobEncoding` gives those bytes a portable
meaning, just as `InlineEncoding` interprets the value slot.

## Handles, encodings, and stores

A blob's handle combines its content hash with a compile-time encoding. The
same bytes have the same content identity, while the encoding tells a caller
how to validate and decode them. Handles fit inline in tribles, so large values
remain ordinary typed graph edges.

Storage is split into small traits:

- `BlobStorePut` inserts encoded values and returns their handles;
- `BlobStoreGet` resolves typed handles;
- `BlobStoreMeta` reports residency metadata without fetching bytes; and
- `BlobStoreList` enumerates stored objects where a backend supports it.

`MemoryRepo`, `Pile`, and remote object stores implement the relevant
capabilities. Content addressing makes repeat insertion idempotent and allows
caches to copy bytes without coordinating their names.

## Fragments carry their attachments

The usual application path does not put each blob manually. `entity!` accepts a
Rust value for a handle-valued attribute, encodes it, and puts the resulting
bytes into the returned fragment's shared attachment store:

```rust,ignore
use triblespace::prelude::*;
use triblespace::prelude::blobencodings::UTF8String;
use triblespace::prelude::inlineencodings::Handle;

attributes! {
    // Local prototype: derive the attribute from its name and encoding.
    pub body: Handle<UTF8String>;
}

let article = entity! {
    body: "A long string which lives in a content-addressed blob.",
};

assert_eq!(article.facts().len(), 1);
```

Composing fragments with `+=` unions their facts, metafacts, exported IDs, and
attachments. `store.commit(collection, &signing_key, fragment)` copies those
attachments before it publishes the signed commit which refers to them. There
is no separate staging manifest to keep in sync.

## Put and get explicitly when needed

Low-level code can still work directly with a store:

```rust,ignore
use triblespace::prelude::*;
use triblespace::prelude::blobencodings::UTF8String;
use triblespace::prelude::inlineencodings::Handle;

let mut store = MemoryBlobStore::new();
let handle: Inline<Handle<UTF8String>> = store.put("Fear is the mind-killer.")?;
let snapshot = store.snapshot()?;
let value: View<str> = snapshot.get(handle)?;
assert_eq!(value.as_ref(), "Fear is the mind-killer.");
```

Explicit insertion is useful for importers, representation builders, and code
which must know a handle before constructing the referring entity.

## Archives are blobs too

Canonical `SimpleArchive` encodes a `TribleSet` as sorted, duplicate-free
64-byte rows. Collection descriptors, commit data, and commit metadata use this
representation. The handle of a descriptor archive is therefore the
collection's identity; the handle of a data archive is one collection element.

SuccinctArchive and other query-oriented formats are also typed blobs. Their
collection encodings define canonical joins, while mappings define canonical
cross-encoding transformations. A materialized derived artifact can therefore
be stored, reused, or forgotten without changing the authority of the signed
source commits.

## Conservative references

Every retained current native record other than a `BLOB` strongly retains each
resident blob it references directly, together with that blob's resident child
closure. This includes unsigned `MERGE` and `DERIVE` equations: their
descriptors, inputs, and results are roots just as a `COMMIT`'s descriptor,
data, and metadata are. Preserved WANT records likewise own their referenced
blobs; self-contained authorization proofs have no payload blob references.
Retention does not depend on signature validity, admission, or whether a
materialized equation is useful. An absent reference neither triggers a fetch
nor prevents resident sibling references from being retained. A `BLOB` record
does not root itself merely by existing.

The default child walker examines complete 32-byte chunks at offsets
`0, 32, 64, ...` from the start of each blob and follows candidates which can
be read from the resident store snapshot. Canonical `SimpleArchive` value slots
lie on these boundaries. Accidental matches can retain extra objects, but the
scanner does not decode schemas or discover handles at arbitrary byte offsets.
Formats which rely on this walk must expose their child handles on its chunk
boundaries.

Pile and Yard also retain the resident record-kind descriptions of retained
frames; the `BLOB` kind description becomes a root when an independent root
selects a blob for retention. See [Garbage Collection and
Forgetting](../garbage-collection.md) for explicit policy roots and backend
rewrite boundaries.

This division keeps tribles compact, blobs verifiable, and publication
self-contained while letting physical storage and cache policy evolve
independently.
