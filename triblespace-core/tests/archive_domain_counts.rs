//! What `SuccinctArchive`'s domain counts actually mean.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! A benchmark census — `number-of-subjects`, `-objects`, `-literals` — was
//! measured at 26.4% of a full-scale run (5,438,076 of 20,596,797 ms over
//! 561M tribles). All three enumerate EVERY trible and hash-dedupe in Rust
//! to produce one integer:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let all: HashSet<Id> = find!(
//!     (e: Id, a: Id, v: Inline<UnknownInline>),
//!     pattern!(&ds.facts, [{ ?e @ ?a: ?v }])
//! ).map(|(e, _, _)| e).collect();
//! ```
//!
//! The archive already stores `entity_count` / `attribute_count` /
//! `value_count` as public fields. The proposal to answer count-distinct
//! from them is only worth anything if those fields mean what their names
//! suggest, so this pins the semantics rather than assuming them — the
//! difference between "the index probably knows" and "here is the
//! substitution".
//!
//! It deliberately uses a set where the three counts DIFFER and where
//! entities also appear in value position, because a fixture in which every
//! count coincides cannot distinguish "distinct entities" from "distinct
//! anything".
