//! Regression: `UnionConstraint` must skip variants that are dead for a row.
//!
//! `UnionConstraint::propose`/`confirm` ask each variant whether it is
//! [`satisfied`](triblespace_core::query::Constraint::satisfied) for every
//! frontier row and drop the contribution of the rows where it is not. The
//! obvious reading of the Term-native lowering — a constant lives below the
//! variable layer, so a non-matching arm simply looks nothing up — says that
//! check is dead machinery. It is not.
//!
//! The gap is a *multi-clause* arm. `pattern!` lowers to an
//! `IntersectionConstraint` with one `TribleSetConstraint` per triple, and
//! `IntersectionConstraint::propose` only consults the children that return
//! `Some` from `estimate` for the variable being proposed. So in an arm like
//! `{ ?p @ nickname: "Ali", city: ?out }` the `nickname` clause is completely
//! absent from the `?out` pass: it neither proposes nor confirms. When `?p` is
//! already bound to an entity whose nickname is *not* `"Ali"`, that arm is
//! logically dead, yet its `city` clause happily proposes the entity's city —
//! and, since a union ORs the per-variant survivors, the arm then confirms its
//! own proposal and the row escapes.
//!
//! The arm's own `satisfied` *does* see it: `TribleSetConstraint::satisfied`
//! evaluates `(e, a, v)` as soon as all three positions have a value, and
//! constant Terms count as values — so the fully-pinned `nickname: "Ali"`
//! clause returns `false` the moment `?p` is bound to the wrong entity, and
//! `IntersectionConstraint::satisfied` conjoins that to kill the arm. The
//! union's liveness gate is the only thing that acts on it.
//!
//! Nothing here is exotic: two arms that gate on one attribute and read a
//! different one is the ordinary shape of "if it's an A give me its city,
//! if it's a B give me its display name".
