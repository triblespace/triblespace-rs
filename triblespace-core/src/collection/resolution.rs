//! Stateless semantic resolution for discovered collection records.
//!
//! Discovery establishes canonical record structure and strict commit
//! self-signatures. This module deliberately starts one layer later: the
//! caller chooses whether membership roots come from authorized commits or an
//! explicit payload cover, and supplies concrete encoding and mapping
//! validation for every eligible claim. Only chosen roots and positively
//! accepted equations participate in the least fixed point.
//!
//! Semantic membership is independent of local blob residency. The resolver
//! retains a compact index of active construction lineage; callers may ask the
//! separate [`collection_physical_cover`] function how a changing resident set
//! covers the stable known frontier.
