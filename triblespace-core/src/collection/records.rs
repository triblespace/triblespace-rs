//! Dense typed records for the top-level collection calculus.
//!
//! [`CollectionCommit`], [`CollectionMerge`], and [`CollectionDerive`] are
//! native algebra records, not graph data. Their canonical representations are
//! the fixed-width byte layouts exposed by their `to_bytes`/`from_bytes`
//! methods. A collection *descriptor* is not a record at all: it is an
//! ordinary [`TribleSet`] stored as a self-describing [`SimpleArchive`], and
//! that blob's handle is the collection identity. See
//! [`descriptor`](crate::collection::descriptor) for reading one.
//!
//! Structural decoding and semantic verification are deliberately separate.
//! Every fixed-width commit or derive payload has a structural representation;
//! a merge additionally rejects noncanonical input order. A decoded commit can
//! still carry an invalid public key or signature; [`CollectionCommit::verify_strict`]
//! performs that cryptographic check over a fixed, domain-separated transcript.
