//! Canonical encodings and mappings for typed collections.
//!
//! Durable collection records carry representation-neutral content hashes.
//! This module restores their physical meaning at the API boundary without
//! inventing a second runtime planner:
//!
//! - a [`CollectionEncoding`] owns the canonical bytes, validation, and join
//!   within one collection;
//! - a [`CollectionDerivation`] lets one target encoding own its canonical,
//!   parameterized, join-preserving conversion from one source encoding;
//! - [`Collection`] binds an encoding to one exact, content-addressed
//!   descriptor.
//!
//! Logical interpretation is deliberately separate in
//! [`TryFromCover`](crate::collection::TryFromCover). An interpretation may join every
//! physical member eagerly or retain an exact cover of mmap-backed shards.
