//! Reading collection descriptor facts.
//!
//! A descriptor is an ordinary [`TribleSet`]: facts constructed with
//! [`entity!`](crate::macros::entity), stored as a
//! [`SimpleArchive`](crate::blob::encodings::simplearchive::SimpleArchive)
//! blob whose handle is the collection identity. The descriptor names its
//! encoding directly, and reading one is an ordinary query over ordinary
//! facts.
//!
//! A root carries [`collection_name`] while a derived collection carries
//! [`collection_source`] and one concrete [`collection_mapping`]
//! instance instead. Mapping parameters hang from that mapping entity, not
//! from the collection descriptor, so the conversion remains independently
//! identifiable and queryable. Both kinds carry independent, self-contained
//! capability policy bindings. Each capability is either open or governed by
//! a quorum over its own canonical root set; there is no privileged collection
//! owner or shared anchor. Policy is never inferred by walking the source
//! chain. Readers query the facts they need; unrelated fields and retired
//! attributes are not a reason to reject the archive. The singular accessors
//! below are explicit diagnostics requiring one descriptor entity and
//! unambiguous field values. Ordinary admission uses [`admission_policies`]
//! and accepts any supported alternative. Executable lineage still requires
//! an unambiguous source and mapping; plural lineage is not defined here.
