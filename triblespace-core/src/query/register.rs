//! Registers — a set of states, an order over them, and the reader's choice.
//!
//! A great many designs model *the same thing, changing over time* as a set
//! of immutable states. What differs between them is never the states; it is
//! **how a reader decides which of them is current**. This module makes that
//! decision a parameter.
//!
//! # A register is an order, and a policy is a choice of order
//!
//! The obvious design has two knobs — an *order* over states and a *policy*
//! for choosing among the maximal ones (multi-value, last-write-wins,
//! first-write-wins, ...). Writing them out, the second knob collapses into
//! the first:
//!
//! | policy | is |
//! |---|---|
//! | multi-value (MV) | the maximal set under a **partial** order |
//! | last-write-wins (LWW) | the maximal set under a **total** order |
//! | first-write-wins (FWW) | the maximal set under that order **reversed** |
//! | named by the reader | the maximal set under the **empty** order |
//!
//! There is exactly one operation — *take the maximal elements* — and the
//! policies are orders to take it under. LWW is not a different computation
//! from MV; it is MV over an order fine enough to leave a singleton, which
//! is why [`sole`] is a *check on the result* rather than a tie-break rule
//! that silently invents one. Manufacturing an order between genuinely
//! concurrent states is the one thing this substrate refuses to do on the
//! reader's behalf.
//!
//! # A register needs two fields, and a timestamp is only one of them
//!
//! A register is a set of states that are *versions of the same thing*,
//! ordered. That is two facts, and an order carrying only one of them
//! cannot be resolved at all. [`ObservationOrder`] gets both from a single
//! edge: "I observed that" says *these are versions of the same thing* and
//! *this one is later* in the same breath, which is why an observation DAG
//! takes no second attribute and needs no scope.
//!
//! A stated key carries no identity whatever. A timestamp says *when*;
//! nothing in it says *of what*. [`StatedOrder`] therefore names the
//! identity as its own attribute, and the two together — an identity and
//! an order — are the whole register.
//!
//! Inferring the identity from a weaker relation over-includes, and must.
//! Compass hangs status events, notes, and priority events off a goal
//! through the *same* `board::task` edge, and every one of them carries a
//! timestamp. `board::task` means *belongs to this goal*, which is not an
//! identity: a note and a status event both belong to the goal and are not
//! versions of one another. Read as identity it lets a note written at
//! t=20 dominate a status event written at t=10, so the goal reports no
//! current status — on 778 of 2939 goals in the live pile.
//!
//! An earlier shape patched that with a scoping knob — admit as dominators
//! only states that also assert a kind tag — reconstructing the composite
//! identity `(goal, status-kind)` out of a grouping plus a type filter.
//! That was never a third axis; it was the missing half of the first,
//! spelled out at every call site. The cure is to give the data the
//! identity it lacks, an attribute meaning *the status of goal G*, after
//! which no scope is wanted: a note is simply not in that register.
//!
//! # Materialized identity lives in the mapping, not at the call site
//!
//! Which attribute carries identity and which carries order is a property
//! of a materialized register, never of the question a reader asks. The
//! source-to-register mapping carries both attributes as ordinary tribles.
//! Its intrinsic id therefore distinguishes two registers over the same
//! source while leaving the shared mapping algorithm independently named and
//! inspectable.
//!
//! An earlier design hashed the two attributes *into* an opaque mapping id.
//! That made the digest the only carrier of the pair: nothing stored them, so
//! no reader could recover which attributes a register was over. The same
//! correction applies to
//! [`latest`](crate::collection::latest)'s observed edge and
//! to a path collection's automaton: both are parameters of content-derived
//! mapping entities embedded in their target descriptors.
//!
//! What is left at the call site is the frame — which commits the reader
//! holds — and nothing else.
//!
//! # There is no global "current"
//!
//! Only the current state **for a given set of commits**. That set is
//! whatever [`TriblePattern`] source the order was built over. Two readers
//! holding different sets legitimately disagree, and both are right; that is
//! frame-relativity, not a consistency bug. `latest`/`resolve` are therefore
//! always asked *in a frame*, never of the data as such.
//!
//! # Monotonicity
//!
//! For a fixed transitive partial order, finite antichains form a lattice
//! joined by taking the maximal elements of their union. Reversing that fixed
//! order gives the corresponding minimum operation.
//!
//! An observation relation is different: new source facts can supply order
//! evidence which neither surviving head id carries. Re-resolving two head
//! sets against their complete union frame is a useful pure operation, but
//! is not a join on bare head sets alone. The maintained
//! [`latest`](crate::collection::latest) collection stores known live states
//! together with every historical superseded target, so its join needs no
//! ambient source graph. Its live projection is neither monotone nor antitone
//! under inclusion; the pair is monotone under its own join order.
//!
//! # Two exposures
//!
//! * [`resolve`] materialises the answer as a set. Sorted into a slice it
//!   becomes a proposing constraint with an **exact** cardinality via
//!   [`SortedSlice`](crate::query::sortedsliceconstraint::SortedSlice), so
//!   the join planner can order around it like any other relation.
//! * [`maximal`] is a streaming filter-only [`Constraint`] in the shape of
//!   [`InlineRange`](crate::query::rangeconstraint::InlineRange): it never
//!   proposes, estimates `usize::MAX` so the planner always sorts it last,
//!   and kills dominated candidates that a `pattern!` proposed. This is the
//!   form that removes the caller's obligation to materialise candidates.
//!
//! # Example
//!
