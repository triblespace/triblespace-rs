//! A Pile is an append-only collection of blobs, collection records, complete
//! capability proofs, wants, and legacy branches stored in a single file. It
//! is designed as a durable local
//! repository storage that can be safely shared between threads.
//!
//! The pile operates as a **WAL-as-a-DB**: the write-ahead log _is_ the database.
//! All indices and metadata are reconstructed from the log on startup and no
//! additional state is persisted elsewhere.
//!
//! The pile treats its file as an immutable append-only log. Once a record lies
//! below `applied_length` and its bytes have been returned by
//! `get` or `apply_next`, those bytes are
//! assumed permanent. Modifying any part of the pile other than appending new
//! records is undefined behaviour. The un-applied tail may hide a partial
//! append after a crash, so validation and repair only operate on offsets
//! beyond `applied_length`. Each record's [`ValidationState`](crate::repo::pile::ValidationState) is cached for the
//! lifetime of the process under this immutability assumption.
//!
//! For layout and recovery details see the [Pile
//! Format](../../book/src/pile-format.md) chapter of the Tribles Book.
