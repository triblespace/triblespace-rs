//! Batched WGPU confirmation for [`SuccinctArchive`] queries.
//!
//! The engine's [`Constraint::confirm`] protocol is kill-only: a confirmer
//! receives one [`Candidates`] region (read-only values and parent tags,
//! killable liveness bits packed into `u32` words) and may only clear them.
//! That contract makes the archive's per-candidate membership probes
//! embarrassingly parallel — every candidate's verdict is independent, and
//! merging GPU verdicts back is a plain word-wise AND.
//!
//! A region spans a whole [`Frontier`], so its candidates do **not** share
//! one parent binding: entry `i` carries the frontier row it was proposed
//! for, and it has to be checked against *that* row's bound values. This is
//! what makes the batched tier reachable below the root — with a width-1
//! frontier only the root's proposal is wide, and every deeper level offers
//! the device a handful of candidates.
//!
//! [`WgpuSuccinctArchive`] wraps a CPU [`SuccinctArchive`] and keeps the
//! structures the confirm probes touch resident on the default WGPU device:
//! the value universe (as big-endian `u32` words for lexicographic binary
//! search), the three axis occupancy boundaries, and the six Ring wavelet
//! matrices. Its [`WgpuSuccinctArchiveConstraint`] mirrors the canonical
//! constraint exactly, except that sufficiently large `confirm` regions are
//! evaluated on the device. The floor is selected from the operation already
//! identified by [`ConfirmPlan`]: range probes amortise at 8,192 live
//! candidates, while the lighter membership probes need 24,576.
//!
//! * **Unbound membership** (no other position bound; the confirmed variable
//!   is E, A, or V): one fused kernel per region — binary search of each
//!   candidate value in the resident universe plus an axis-boundary
//!   occupancy check — writes one packed verdict word per 32 candidates.
//!   Parent tags do not enter: the verdict does not depend on the parent
//!   binding.
//! * **Range restriction** (one or two other positions bound): the host
//!   ships a *parent table* — one row per distinct parent tag in the region,
//!   holding that parent's bound values — plus one table slot per candidate.
//!   The device resolves the table to one row band per parent out of the
//!   same resident universe and boundary tables the probes use, then every
//!   candidate reads its own parent's band through its slot. The host never
//!   searches the universe or ranks a wavelet; it copies bound values and
//!   assigns slots.
//!
//! Below the threshold, on any device error, and for every other protocol
//! method, the wrapper defers to the canonical CPU constraint, so results are
//! bit-identical either way. `tests/batch_confirm_parity.rs` holds the two
//! paths to identical liveness words for every arm against a frontier of
//! one; `tests/mixed_parent_parity.rs` does the same for engine-produced
//! regions spanning many parents.
//!
//! # Packed verdict words
//!
//! Core's liveness is bit-packed: a `u32` carries
//! [`LIVENESS_WORD_BITS`] candidates and a region does not start on a word
//! boundary. So the verdict kernels write **packed** verdict words — the flat
//! index is the bit position in the region's liveness word array, one
//! `plane_ballot` per plane yields a whole 32-candidate word already in the
//! right bit order, and one lane per word stores it. See
//! `membership_confirm_ballot_kernel` for the layout argument and its
//! store-exclusivity conditions, and
//! `WgpuSuccinctArchive::require_plane_packing` for the device property they
//! rest on.
//!
//! The probe-fill kernels stay **candidate**-indexed: their outputs feed
//! Jerky's per-candidate rank batch, which knows nothing about liveness. Only
//! their liveness *input* is bit-addressed, through `candidate_is_live`.
//!
//! The host merge — `live_words()`, [`and_words`], `set_live_words()` over a
//! *private* copy — knows nothing about the packing, because those three are
//! an abstraction over liveness *words* rather than over candidates. The
//! device never touches the shared `ProposalBuffer` liveness, so a confirm
//! cannot disturb the neighbouring regions that share its first and last
//! word: the copy-in/copy-out boundary is the guard, `live_words()` zeroes the
//! bits the region does not own on the way out, and `set_live_words()`
//! refuses to write them on the way back in.

// The `#[cube]` kernels below nest their guards rather than joining them
// with `&&`. That is load-bearing, not style: a device `&&` evaluates both
// sides, so `d < m && universe[d * 8] == ..` would index past the resident
// universe for the `d == m` (value absent) case that the guard exists to
// exclude. Nesting is uniform across the kernels so no reader has to work
// out which guards may be joined and which may not.

///   a word boundary. This holds whether or not cubecl spreads the dispatch
///   over 2 or 3 grid dimensions, because the `y`/`z` strides it uses are both
///   multiples of `CUBE_DIM`.
/// * **(b)** the plane is exactly 32 lanes, so one plane owns exactly one word
///   and no word straddles two planes. Checked on the host in
///   [`WgpuSuccinctArchive::require_plane_packing`]: below 32, two planes would
///   each store the same word and the last writer would win; above 32, lane 32
///   would need ballot component 1 and this kernel hardcodes component 0.
/// * **(c)** `UNIT_POS_PLANE` (WGSL `subgroup_invocation_id`) is the lane's
///   position in the linear order the flat id follows, so ballot bit `L` is the
///   verdict of the lane whose `b` is `plane_base + L`. True on every Metal and
