//! Collection-scoped anti-entropy for triblespace.
//!
//! [`Peer<S>`](peer::Peer) wraps one store. Periodic per-request authorized
//! PATCH walks converge one explicitly active collection's records and
//! collection-scoped native evidence for descriptor-declared capabilities. A separate
//! stock-gossip wake plane carries only a signed endpoint origin and opaque
//! per-collection anti-entropy root; knowing the collection handle is its
//! discovery capability, while every useful collection byte remains
//! capability-gated.
//! Exact content reads are independent: every served resident blob may publish
//! a full-width opaque locator derived from its bearer handle H. The selected
//! endpoint proves H before the requester proves H, both proofs bind their
//! authenticated endpoint identities, and returned bytes must hash to H.
//!
//! Semantic snapshots and local writes remain synchronous. Explicit exact-blob
//! reads through [`PeerSnapshot`](peer::PeerSnapshot) await acquisition while
//! keeping the captured collection and authorization observation unchanged.
