# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.41.2] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed
- **`pile net sync --peers <EndpointTicket>` now actually
  bypasses discovery** for the supplied tickets. Previously
  (0.41.1) the sync command parsed tickets and threaded
  their `EndpointAddr` through to `PeerConfig.peers`, but
  the gossip / DHT bootstrap path inside `triblespace-net`
  used only the bare `EndpointId` for connect, falling back
  to iroh's discovery to find the addresses. As of 0.41.2,
  the ticket addresses are seeded into iroh's address
  lookup via `triblespace-net`'s new
  `StaticAddressLookup`, so the bootstrap connect resolves
  locally — no pkarr publish or DNS roundtrip needed.

### Notes
- This closes the "tickets work for pull but not sync"
  asymmetry from 0.41.1. Both commands now behave the same
  way w.r.t. ticket addresses.

## [0.41.1] - 2026-05-17

### Added
- **`pile net identity` prints an `EndpointTicket`** in
  addition to the bare pubkey. Carries only the id at
  identity-time (no relay/direct addrs); use the richer
  ticket printed by `pile net sync` at startup for
  direct-dial scenarios.
- **`pile net sync --peers <STR>`** accepts `EndpointTicket`s
  (the rich form, `endpoint…`) in addition to bare hex
  pubkeys. The address info is decoded but only the id is
  threaded into gossip bootstrap for now — address-cache
  seeding for sync's gossip path is a follow-up.
- **`pile net pull <REMOTE>`** accepts an `EndpointTicket` as
  the `<REMOTE>` argument. End-to-end discovery-free: the
  address info is threaded down to iroh's
  `Endpoint::connect`, so the pull works in
  sandbox / corporate-proxy environments where iroh
  discovery is blocked.
- **`pile net sync` prints a rich `EndpointTicket`** to
  stderr once the iroh endpoint is online (from
  triblespace-net's host loop) — id + relay URL + direct
  addresses. This is the form to share with a remote peer
  for direct dial.

### Notes
- `iroh-tickets 0.5` added as a dependency for ticket
  parsing.

## [0.41.0] - 2026-05-16

### Changed
- **Iroh family bumped 0.97 → 0.98** via `triblespace-net`
  0.41.0. Replaces the 0.40.3 Cargo.lock-shipping workaround
  with a real upstream resolution: `iroh-base 0.98` no longer
  pins to the broken `ed25519-dalek 3.0.0-pre.1`. See
  `triblespace-net/CHANGELOG.md` for details.

No surface CLI changes; same commands, same env vars, same
output.

## [0.40.3] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed
- **Ship `Cargo.lock` in the published crate** so
  `cargo install trible --locked` resolves a known-good
  transitive dependency tree. The 0.40.2 publish accidentally
  omitted the lockfile (workspace gitignores it; the publish
  clone had none); fresh resolution then picked
  `ed25519 v3.0.0` (released 2026-05-03) against
  `ed25519-dalek 3.0.0-pre.1` (hard-pinned by
  `iroh-base 0.97` via `=3.0.0-pre.1`), and the pair don't
  compile together — `ed25519::pkcs8::Error::KeyMalformed`
  became a tuple variant in `ed25519 3.0.0` but
  `ed25519-dalek 3.0.0-pre.1` still uses it as a unit
  variant. The shipped lockfile pins a working combination.
- `trible 0.40.2` is yanked from crates.io.

No source changes from 0.40.2 — same TLS-platform-verifier
fix carries through. The iroh upstream pin will eventually be
fixed by a `triblespace-net` bump to `iroh 0.98` or later
(both `iroh-base 0.98` and `1.0.0-rc.0` pin pre.6/pre.7,
which compile against `ed25519 3.0.0`). Deferred since the
lockfile fix is the minimum-disruption resolution.

## [0.40.2] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- **`tracing-subscriber` initialised at `main()` entry**, gated
  on the standard `RUST_LOG` env var via `EnvFilter`. Default
  filter is `warn`, so the CLI is quiet without configuration;
  `RUST_LOG=triblespace_net=info trible pile net sync …` lights
  up the auth handshake + per-op events introduced in
  `triblespace-net` Unreleased. Output goes to stderr so it
  doesn't interleave with command output on stdout. The
  `tracing-subscriber` dep was already declared in
  `Cargo.toml`; this commit wires it through.

## [0.38.0] - 2026-05-07

### Removed (breaking)
- **`pile net sync --topic` flag.** The gossip mesh is now
  identified by `TRIBLE_TEAM_ROOT` directly — every team has
  exactly one gossip mesh, derived from its identity. Users no
  longer pick + coordinate a separate topic string with
  invitees. Migration: drop the `--topic` flag from any sync
  invocation; the mesh topic is now always the team root
  pubkey. Falls back to single-user team-of-one (the node's
  own pubkey) when `TRIBLE_TEAM_ROOT` isn't set.

## [0.37.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- `team show <CAP_HEX>` — chain-walk diagnostic for a single
  capability. Prints each level (subject, issuer, scope,
  expiry, sig blob handle, cap blob handle) plus a
  signer-matches-issuer check at every step. Bounded by
  `MAX_DEPTH = 32`; embedded parent sigs at depth `N>0`
  render with `(embedded in level above)` rather than a
  separate handle. Complements `team list`'s summary view —
  use `show` when `list` reports a cap is present but a
  connection still fails.
- `team show --verify <PUBKEY_HEX>` runs `verify_chain`
  against the given team root and prints `✓ VERIFIED` or
  `✗ FAILED — <VerifyError>`. Same code path the relay's
  `OP_AUTH` uses; the result is the local-side rehearsal of
  what a real connection attempt would produce. Reads
  `TRIBLE_TEAM_ROOT` env var by default;
  `--expected-subject` overrides the default leaf-subject
  check for subject-substitution detection.
- `--version` / `-V` flag — basic CLI hygiene; prints the
  binary's `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` and exits.

### Changed
- `team list` now sorts capabilities by expiry
  soonest-first, surfaces `(revoker, target)` pairs for each
  verifiable revocation, and includes branch-scope details
  when a cap was issued with `--branch`.
- `team {create, invite}` echo the cap's expiry timestamp
  in the printed output so the operator sees rotation
  deadlines without an extra `team list` call.
- `pile net {sync, pull}` now read `TRIBLE_TEAM_ROOT` and
  `TRIBLE_TEAM_CAP` env vars consistently; missing-env
  diagnosis goes through `pile net status`.

### Documentation
- `README` documents `pile net` and `team` subcommand groups
  alongside the existing `pile branch` / `pile blob` /
  `store` sections.

## [0.36.0] - 2026-04-28
### Added
- `team` subcommand group for capability-based team management:
  - `team create` mints a fresh team root keypair, signs the founder's
    self-cap with admin scope, prints the team root pubkey + SECRET (to
    archive offline) + cap handles + the cap's expiry timestamp.
  - `team invite` issues a sub-cap to a teammate, delegating from the
    running node's own cap. Optional `--branch <BRANCH_HEX>` (repeatable)
    restricts the cap to specific branches.
  - `team revoke` issues a team-root-signed revocation against a pubkey,
    cascading transitively through any chain involving the revoked key.
  - `team list` audits the pile: per-cap details (issuer → subject,
    PERM_*/branches/expiry — sorted soonest-expiry-first) plus the
    `(revoker, target)` pairs for each verifiable revocation.
  - `team show --cap HEX` walks one chain end-to-end and prints
    each level (subject, issuer, scope, expiry, sig blob handle,
    cap blob handle, signer-matches-issuer check). Bounded by
    `MAX_DEPTH = 32`; embedded parent sigs at depth N>0 render
    with the `(embedded in level above)` label rather than a
    separate handle. The diagnostic deep-dive for "why is this
    cap rejected" — complements `team list`'s summary view.
  - `team show --verify <PUBKEY_HEX>` runs `verify_chain` against
    the given team root and prints `✓ VERIFIED` or `✗ FAILED —
    <VerifyError>`. The same code path the relay's `OP_AUTH`
    uses, so the result mirrors what a real connection attempt
    would see. Reads `TRIBLE_TEAM_ROOT` env var by default;
    `--expected-subject` overrides the default check (leaf cap's
    own subject) for subject-substitution-attack detection.
- `pile net sync` / `pile net pull` now read `TRIBLE_TEAM_ROOT` and
  `TRIBLE_TEAM_CAP` env vars for multi-user team operation; without them,
  fall back to single-user team-of-one (`team_root = signing_key.verifying_key()`).
- `pile net status` diagnostic subcommand: prints the node id, team
  root, and self_cap that the running peer would present on
  `OP_AUTH`, annotated with their source ("from TRIBLE_TEAM_ROOT"
  vs "single-user fallback" vs "NOT SET — remote will reject"). For
  debugging stuck-auth scenarios in one shot.
### Changed
- Pile-sync wire protocol bumped to v4 (`/triblespace/pile-sync/4`):
  every connection's first stream must be `OP_AUTH` presenting the
  caller's cap-sig handle; the server walks the chain back to the
  configured team root and either accepts (subsequent streams gated by
  the verified cap's scope) or rejects. Branch- and blob-level scope
  gates: `OP_LIST` / `OP_HEAD` filter by `granted_branches`, while
  `OP_GET_BLOB` / `OP_CHILDREN` reject blobs outside the reachable set
  from allowed heads (closes the raw-hash bypass).
- `team list`'s revocations section surfaces full `(revoker, target)`
  pairs, not just a count.

## [0.35.0] - 2026-04-18
### Added
- `pile branch reflog` command to list historical branch head updates (including tombstones) stored in a pile file.
- `pile branch journal` command to scan a pile for all branch update/tombstone records and report the latest state per branch id.
- `pile branch set` command to CAS-update a branch head to a specific branch-metadata handle (useful for recovery).
- `pile diagnose locate-hash` to scan raw pile bytes and report where a blob handle appears (header vs payload references).
- `pile net {identity, sync, pull}` subcommands for distributed pile sync over iroh (gossip + DHT + QUIC), built on `triblespace-net`.
### Changed
- `pile diagnose` is now a subcommand group (`check`, `locate-hash`) instead of a single command.
- `pile branch stats` now defaults to a fast path that reports accumulated content bytes and accumulated triple count from blob metadata (`length / 64`) without materializing commit payload tribles.
- `pile branch stats --full` retains the previous deep scan behavior for unique triples/entities/attributes.
- `trible` now lives in the `triblespace-rs` workspace as a first-class member, sharing the `Cargo.lock` with `triblespace-core` / `triblespace-net` / the facade. Dev experience: a single `cargo test --workspace` run exercises CLI, library, and protocol tests together.
### Fixed
- `pile create` now explicitly touches the target path before `Pile::open`. `Pile::open` stopped auto-creating files at triblespace-core 0.32.1 but the CLI hadn't been updated to match; `pile create` on a fresh path returned `No such file or directory`.
- `branch pull` does the same touch-before-open when the local pile is a fresh path.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-02-09
### Changed
- Updated CLI dependencies and replaced `rand` with `getrandom` for generating random ids and ephemeral signing keys.
- `pile branch create` now mints branch ids with `genid` (high-entropy random ids) instead of `ufoid` (time-prefixed ids).

## [0.11.1] - 2026-02-08
